This is a mortgage payment calculator. **It excludes PMI, homeowner's insurance, and any taxes.** 

You can type in your `home cost` and use any of the sliders to adjust your `downpayment`, your `interest rate`, and your `term`. The calculation is automatically re-evaluated as you adjust each input.

The app is displayed in *Showcase* mode so that you can observe the code for the UI and the actual operations of it. Feel free to borrow as needed!
